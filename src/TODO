MISSING:

-Sphere:
	-doesn't work for non-uniform scale
-Cylinder:
	-should we make a bounding box in object space then transform?
-BvhNode:
	-intersects, ray direction

BROKEN:

-Box:
	-null pointer exception

UNCLEAR:

-Box + Triangle:
	-use this to set minBound, maxBound, averagePosition
-Bvh:
	-Vector3.set(...);
		-used with min.set(...);
	-use of root in the recursive call? or at all?
